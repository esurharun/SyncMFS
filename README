SyncMFS is GridFS based file synchronization system over cloud and remote computers.

It is at very very early stage and it should not be using on production environment for now.

--


USAGE

After you build it you should create a .syncmfs file on your home directory or current directory you are using it.

Then you are free to commit or update or synch your directory tree

For example;

mkdir folder1
java -jar syncmfs.jar -s <path_to_.syncmfs_file> UPDATE

If you want to commit your changes

java -jar syncmfs.jar -s <path_to_.syncmfs_file> COMMIT  

would be enough. 

You can update your folder1 for remote changes by using UPDATE command also. And by the way you can see remote or local changes by using STATUS or RSTATUS actions.


You should have sbt to build it. And it also has one-jar plugin support to build it as single jar file with all dependencies.


Known problems:

- Removed directories stays empty on some update cases
- No chunk based updates or something like rsync does, it just uploads or downloads whole files


Planning additions:

- File versioning
- Watch-dog mode to real-time synchronize with local changes and timed checks and synchronization with remote
- Mac-OSX, Linux and Windows UI's
