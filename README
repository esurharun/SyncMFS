SyncMFS is GridFS based file synchronization system over cloud and remote computers.

It is at very very early stage and it should not be using on production environment for now.

You should have sbt to build it. And it also has one-jar plugin support to build it as single jar file with all dependencies.



Planning additions:

- File versioning
- Watch-dog mode to real-time synchronize with local changes and timed checks and synchronization with remote
- Mac-OSX, Linux and Windows UI's
